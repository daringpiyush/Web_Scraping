PBHA’s dual-focused mission is to provide vital resources to local communities and grow public service leaders.

Simultaneously, PBHA launched top-to-bottom usage of Google Applications for email, documents, calendar, and intranet, used to enhance and complement consistent use of the Salesforce.com platform. Over 80 student program directors are entrusted with Customer Service Portal usernames and secure access to manage their own program’s information, while about 20 staff and officers have full user licenses. Up to this date, the Salesforce.com instance has been minimally enhanced and extended via customization and 3rd party applications to support PBHA’s unique use cases.  In spring of this year, PBHA launches Fundraising and Development tracking system within Salesforce.com to replace a Paradigm-based system, as well as beginning increased functionality and processes for public forms, community partner relationship management, and customizations for particular programs, especially PBHA’s Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Summer Urban Program.

      "Since 1987 IMPACT Boston has been a leader in personal safety and self- defense training. Our curriculum presents students with realistic scenarios of threat, intimidation and imminent danger. Through repeated practice of fighting full-force in an adrenalized state, students learn to respond effectively to dangerous situations. Additionally, our organizational philosophy emphasizes abuse prevention, healing, empowerment, social justice, awareness and sensitivity to students' histories of trauma.\n",

      "IMPACT teaches women, men, children, and teens and has created customized programs for numerous groups including people with disabilities, abuse survivors, LGBTQ people, and high school students.

PBHA is the umbrella organization for 86 student-directed programs, supported by full-time staff members. Together, these programs strive for change on multiple levels in the Boston and Cambridge communities. PBHA’s dual-focused mission is to provide vital resources to local communities and grow public service leaders. Often called “the best course at Harvard,” PBHA programs provide students with experiences and wisdom that cannot be learned within classroom walls. At the same time, by utilizing student initiative and working in close collaboration with constituents, our programs meet genuine community needs in innovative ways.\n",

Throughout the next year, Salesforce.com was implemented to support Program, Volunteer and Participant Management; Attendance, Assessment, and Training tracking; program Goal-setting; and general contact and relationship management.  Simultaneously, PBHA launched top-to-bottom usage of Google Applications for email, documents, calendar, and intranet, used to enhance and complement consistent use of the Salesforce.com platform. Over 80 student program directors are entrusted with Customer Service Portal usernames and secure access to manage their own program’s information, while about 20 staff and officers have full user licenses. Up to this date, the Salesforce.com instance has been minimally enhanced and extended via customization and 3rd party applications to support PBHA’s unique use cases.  In spring of this year, PBHA launches Fundraising and Development tracking system within Salesforce.com to replace a Paradigm-based system, as well as beginning increased functionality and processes for public forms, community partner relationship management, and customizations for particular programs, especially PBHA’s Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Summer Urban Program.  PBHA has built an integrated and flexible technology platform that aligns and supports the strategic vision for organizational growth. \n",

We partner with over 900 schools - both district and charter - in underserved communities around the country, thus impacting more than 330,000 students.

We work to deepen our understanding of how race, class, power and privilege influence the education system as well as influence our own perspectives. To do so, we provide ongoing learning opportunities through org-wide professional development, affinity groups, working groups, and resource sharing.\n",
      " \n",
      "Individuals who join ANet have the opportunity to be part of a dynamic, values driven, and team-oriented organization that is committed to having impact in schools by investing in each other and learning together. We were named as The NonProfit Times “Best Nonprofits to Work For” and work tirelessly to foster a working environment where the unique perspectives, backgrounds, and identities of our staff members are valued.\n",

      "We are seeking a strategic, equity- and people-driven Vice President, Talent to ensure all talent initiatives, processes, and policies work in direct support of ANet's goal to be a diverse, inclusive, and anti-racist organization. This individual will set an org-wide talent vision and provide strategic support to all functional talent areas, including human resources & people operations, talent development, and recruitment & staffing support.

PBHA’s dual-focused mission is to provide vital resources to local communities and grow public service leaders.

Simultaneously, PBHA launched top-to-bottom usage of Google Applications for email, documents, calendar, and intranet, used to enhance and complement consistent use of the Salesforce.com platform.

      "Since 1987 IMPACT Boston has been a leader in personal safety and self- defense training. Our curriculum presents students with realistic scenarios of threat, intimidation and imminent danger. Through repeated practice of fighting full-force in an adrenalized state, students learn to respond effectively to dangerous situations. Additionally, our organizational philosophy emphasizes abuse prevention, healing, empowerment, social justice, awareness and sensitivity to students' histories of trauma.\n",

      "IMPACT teaches women, men, children, and teens and has created customized programs for numerous groups including people with disabilities, abuse survivors, LGBTQ people, and high school students.

Together, these programs strive for change on multiple levels in the Boston and Cambridge communities. PBHA’s dual-focused mission is to provide vital resources to local communities and grow public service leaders.

Simultaneously, PBHA launched top-to-bottom usage of Google Applications for email, documents, calendar, and intranet, used to enhance and complement consistent use of the Salesforce.com platform. Over 80 student program directors are entrusted with Customer Service Portal usernames and secure access to manage their own program’s information, while about 20 staff and officers have full user licenses. Up to this date, the Salesforce.com instance has been minimally enhanced and extended via customization and 3rd party applications to support PBHA’s unique use cases.  In spring of this year, PBHA launches Fundraising and Development tracking system within Salesforce.com to replace a Paradigm-based system, as well as beginning increased functionality and processes for public forms, community partner relationship management, and customizations for particular programs, especially PBHA’s Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Summer Urban Program.

      "Since 1987 IMPACT Boston has been a leader in personal safety and self- defense training. Our curriculum presents students with realistic scenarios of threat, intimidation and imminent danger. Through repeated practice of fighting full-force in an adrenalized state, students learn to respond effectively to dangerous situations. Additionally, our organizational philosophy emphasizes abuse prevention, healing, empowerment, social justice, awareness and sensitivity to students' histories of trauma.\n",

Together, these programs strive for change on multiple levels in the Boston and Cambridge communities. PBHA’s dual-focused mission is to provide vital resources to local communities and grow public service leaders. Often called “the best course at Harvard,” PBHA programs provide students with experiences and wisdom that cannot be learned within classroom walls.

Simultaneously, PBHA launched top-to-bottom usage of Google Applications for email, documents, calendar, and intranet, used to enhance and complement consistent use of the Salesforce.com platform. Over 80 student program directors are entrusted with Customer Service Portal usernames and secure access to manage their own program’s information, while about 20 staff and officers have full user licenses. Up to this date, the Salesforce.com instance has been minimally enhanced and extended via customization and 3rd party applications to support PBHA’s unique use cases.  In spring of this year, PBHA launches Fundraising and Development tracking system within Salesforce.com to replace a Paradigm-based system, as well as beginning increased functionality and processes for public forms, community partner relationship management, and customizations for particular programs, especially PBHA’s Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Summer Urban Program.
